It took a while to shake off the day's thoughts, and a short meditation helped bring tranquility. I woke briefly around 1:00 AM, navigated a dream, and jotted down fragments. Despite the interruptions, I felt surprisingly rested when the 7:00 AM alarm marked the morning. Tomorrow, I'll focus on enhancing pre-sleep relaxation techniques for a more uninterrupted night.",
